# video_experiments
an experimental interactive video player built on opencv-python

Run this in Pycharm. Be sure to use opencv-python version 4.5.5.64. (Install with 'pip install opencv-python==4.5.5.64'.)
This runs in a python 3.8 environment on Windows, but tkinter UI seems to be broken on mac, in which case, use python 3.10 instead.
