# video experiments with opencv
an experimental interactive video player built on opencv-python

Run this in Pycharm. Be sure to use opencv-python version 4.5.5.64 (install with 'pip install opencv-python==4.5.5.64'). Older versions may also work but 4.6.x has some sort of fatal issues.
This runs in a python 3.8 environment on Windows, but tkinter UI seems to be broken on mac. In which case, use python 3.10 instead.
